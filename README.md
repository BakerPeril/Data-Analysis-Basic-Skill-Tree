# Data-Analysis-Basic-Skill-Tree
this repository was written for runoob like me,it can also be used as a record of my learning data analysis. 

## The reason for creating this repository
想着学习数据分析已经好久了，但是始终没有好好的静下心来整理下自己已经学到的知识。
在上班的时候突发奇想，为什么不试试在github上创建一个仓库来记录下自己的所学所感呢？因此就有了这个仓库。
希望能给大家提供借鉴，也希望能在github上留下一点什么，毕竟我觉得这很酷！！

I have been thinking about data analysis for a long time, but I haven't had a good time to sort out what I have learned.
When I was working, I had a whimsy, why not try to create a repository on github to record what I have learned? So there is this repository.
I hope to provide you with a reference, and hope to leave something on github, after all, I think this is cool! !


## The classification
根据我的理解，我对数据分析技能分成了以上几个部分
+ 如何获取数据
+ 如何清洗数据
+ 如何管理数据
+ 如何分析数据
+ 如何理解业务
+ 如何展示数据

According to my understanding, it is divided into the following parts
+ how to get data
+ how to clean the data
+ how to manage data
+ how to analyze data
+ how to understand business
+ how to display data



***我会尽量在我写的每部分里面注明我所参考的作者以及出处。***
I will try to indicate the author and source I refer to in each part I write. 

***另外英语是我的弱项，但是我仍然希望能用英语来写一些。即使是用谷歌翻译，我也是会自己进行人工校对，希望能边学边提高。***
In addition, English is my weakness, but I still hope to write some in English. 
Even if I use Google Translate, I will do manual proofreading myself, hoping to learn while improving.
